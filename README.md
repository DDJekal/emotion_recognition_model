# Emotion Recognition Model with Keras Convolutional Networks

![Emotion Recognition](emotion_recognition_banner.png)

## Description
This repository contains the code for an emotion recognition model built using Keras convolutional networks. The model is designed to predict emotions based on facial expressions from images. It can recognize seven different emotions: happy, sad, angry, neutral, fear, disgust, and surprise.

2. Install the required dependencies:
## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset: Prepare your dataset: Organize your dataset into separate folders for each emotion. Make sure the images are grayscale and of size (48, 48) pixels.

2. Train the model: Use the `train.py` script to train the emotion recognition model on your dataset. Adjust hyperparameters as needed.

3. Evaluate the model: After training, use the `evaluate.py` script to evaluate the model on a test dataset. See the results and performance metrics.

4. Predict emotions: Use the `predict.py` script to predict emotions from new facial expression images.

## Dataset
The dataset used to train and evaluate the model is not included in this repository. You can use your own dataset or explore publicly available emotion recognition datasets.

## Model Architecture
The emotion recognition model is built using Keras convolutional networks. It utilizes a pre-trained CNN (e.g., EfficientNetB0) as a feature extractor and custom dense layers for emotion prediction.

## Training
You can train the model on your dataset using the `train.py` script. Customize the script with the appropriate parameters and paths to your data.

## Evaluation
Use the `evaluate.py` script to evaluate the trained model on a test dataset. It provides accuracy, loss, and other metrics to assess the model's performance.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset. For more detailed results and analysis, please refer to the [Results](results/) directory.
